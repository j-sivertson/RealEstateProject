# RealEstateProject

This project was created as a homework assignment for my CS 115 class (Object-Oriented Programming) in Java.

## Purpose

The purose of this program is to be able to add listing, view your listings, and then create bids for those listings. Go ahead and look at the code to get a better understanidng of what I am talking about.

## Getting started

Pull the code in whatever way you would like and then the main method is found within the REO class. This will then print instructions to the console. Follows those.
